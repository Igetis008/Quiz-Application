# Quiz System with MySQL Backend - Complete Summary

## Project Overview

This quiz system allows users to take quizzes on various topics with two distinct modes:
1. **Admin Mode**: For adding new questions and viewing existing questions
2. **Player Mode**: For taking quizzes on selected categories

The system uses a MySQL database backend for storing questions and categories.

## Files to Create

1. **database_setup.md** - SQL commands for creating the database and inserting sample questions
2. **database.py** - Database connection and operations
3. **admin.py** - Admin mode functionality
4. **player.py** - Player mode functionality
5. **main.py** - Main program entry point
6. **utils.py** - Utility functions for input validation
7. **program_design.md** - Program architecture documentation
8. **database_connection.md** - Database connection implementation details
9. **admin_mode.md** - Admin mode implementation details
10. **player_mode.md** - Player mode implementation details
11. **main_program.md** - Main program implementation details
12. **theory_explanations.md** - Theory explanations for all components

## Database Structure

The system uses a MySQL database named `quizdb` with a single table `questions`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE questions (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    category TEXT,
    question TEXT,
    option_a TEXT,
    option_b TEXT,
    option_c TEXT,
    option_d TEXT,
    answer CHAR(1)
);
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Execute the SQL commands in `database_setup.md` using MySQL Workbench or another MySQL client
   - This will create the database, table, and insert sample questions

2. **Python Environment**:
   - Install the required MySQL connector: `pip install mysql-connector-python`
   - Create all the Python files as specified above
   - Update the database connection credentials in `database.py` with your MySQL username and password

3. **Running the Program**:
   - Execute `python main.py` to start the quiz system
   - Choose between Admin Mode and Player Mode from the main menu

## Features Implemented

- **Menu-driven interface** for easy navigation
- **Input validation** for all user inputs
- **Randomized question selection** for varied quiz experiences
- **Score tracking** with percentage calculation and personalized feedback
- **Clean terminal output** with visual separators and formatting
- **Error handling** for database connections and user inputs
- **Modular design** for easy maintenance and extension

## Admin Mode Features

- Add new questions with category, question text, 4 options, and correct answer
- View all questions stored in the database
- Exit admin mode to return to the main menu

## Player Mode Features

- View list of available categories
- Select a category for the quiz
- Answer 5 random questions from the selected category
- Immediate feedback on answers (correct/incorrect)
- Final score display with percentage and personalized feedback
