# Theory Explanations

## 1. How the Program Connects to MySQL

The program uses the `mysql-connector-python` library to establish a connection to the MySQL database. Here's how it works:

### Connection Process:
1. **Import Library**: The program imports `mysql.connector` which provides the necessary functions to connect to MySQL.
2. **Connection Parameters**: The program specifies connection details:
   - `host`: Usually 'localhost' for local databases
   - `database`: The name of the database ('quizdb' in our case)
   - `user`: MySQL username (typically 'root' for local development)
   - `password`: MySQL user password
3. **Establish Connection**: The `mysql.connector.connect()` function creates a connection object.
4. **Error Handling**: Try-except blocks catch connection errors and provide meaningful feedback.
5. **Connection Validation**: The program checks if the connection is successful using `connection.is_connected()`.

### Code Example:
```python
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import Error

def create_connection():
    connection = None
    try:
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host='localhost',
            database='quizdb',
            user='root',
            password='password'
        )
        if connection.is_connected():
            print("Successfully connected to MySQL database")
            return connection
    except Error as e:
        print(f"Error while connecting to MySQL: {e}")
        return None
```

## 2. How Admin and Player Modes are Implemented

The program uses a menu-driven approach to implement the two modes:

### Mode Selection:
1. **Main Menu**: The program presents a main menu with options for Admin Mode, Player Mode, or Exit.
2. **User Input**: The program waits for user input to determine which mode to enter.
3. **Mode Routing**: Based on user input, the program calls the appropriate mode function.

### Admin Mode Implementation:
- **Menu System**: Displays options for adding questions, viewing questions, or exiting.
- **Question Management**: Uses database functions to add new questions or retrieve all questions.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures correct data entry for questions and answers.
- **User Feedback**: Provides confirmation messages for successful operations.

### Player Mode Implementation:
- **Category Selection**: Retrieves and displays available categories from the database.
- **Quiz Flow**: Guides the user through selecting a category and taking a quiz.
- **Question Presentation**: Displays questions and options in a readable format.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of correct answers and calculates the final score.

## 3. How SQL INSERT Works for Adding Questions

The program uses parameterized SQL INSERT statements to add questions to the database:

### Process:
1. **Data Collection**: The admin mode collects question data (category, question text, options, correct answer).
2. **Parameterized Query**: Uses placeholders (%s) in the SQL statement to prevent SQL injection.
3. **Value Binding**: Passes actual values as a tuple to the execute() method.
4. **Transaction Commit**: Calls `connection.commit()` to save changes to the database.

### Code Example:
```python
def add_question(connection, category, question, option_a, option_b, option_c, option_d, answer):
    try:
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        query = """INSERT INTO questions (category, question, option_a, option_b, option_c, option_d, answer) 
                   VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)"""
        values = (category, question, option_a, option_b, option_c, option_d, answer)
        cursor.execute(query, values)
        connection.commit()
        print("Question added successfully!")
        return True
    except Error as e:
        print(f"Error while adding question: {e}")
        return False
    finally:
        if cursor:
            cursor.close()
```

### Benefits of Parameterized Queries:
- **Security**: Prevents SQL injection attacks
- **Performance**: Database can cache query plans
- **Data Integrity**: Properly handles special characters in data

## 4. How Python Fetches Data with SQL SELECT for Quiz Questions

The program uses SQL SELECT statements to retrieve questions from the database:

### Process:
1. **Query Construction**: Creates appropriate SELECT statements based on requirements.
2. **Cursor Creation**: Creates a cursor object to execute the query.
3. **Query Execution**: Uses `cursor.execute()` to run the query.
4. **Data Retrieval**: Uses `cursor.fetchall()` to retrieve all matching rows.
5. **Resource Cleanup**: Closes the cursor to free up resources.

### Examples:

#### Get All Questions:
```python
def get_all_questions(connection):
    try:
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        query = "SELECT * FROM questions"
        cursor.execute(query)
        questions = cursor.fetchall()
        return questions
    except Error as e:
        print(f"Error while fetching questions: {e}")
        return []
    finally:
        if cursor:
            cursor.close()
```

#### Get Random Questions:
```python
def get_random_questions(connection, category, limit=5):
    try:
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        query = """SELECT id, question, option_a, option_b, option_c, option_d, answer 
                   FROM questions 
                   WHERE category = %s 
                   ORDER BY RAND() 
                   LIMIT %s"""
        cursor.execute(query, (category, limit))
        questions = cursor.fetchall()
        return questions
    except Error as e:
        print(f"Error while fetching random questions: {e}")
        return []
    finally:
        if cursor:
            cursor.close()
```

### Key Features:
- **Randomization**: Uses `ORDER BY RAND()` to randomize question selection
- **Filtering**: Uses WHERE clause to filter by category
- **Limiting**: Uses LIMIT clause to control the number of questions returned
- **Column Selection**: Specifies exact columns needed to optimize performance

## 5. How the Score is Calculated and Displayed

The program tracks and displays scores during the quiz:

### Score Calculation Process:
1. **Initialization**: Score is initialized to 0 at the start of the quiz.
2. **Answer Checking**: For each question, the program compares the user's answer with the correct answer.
3. **Score Increment**: Score is incremented by 1 for each correct answer.
4. **Percentage Calculation**: Final percentage is calculated as (score / total_questions) * 100.

### Code Example:
```python
# Initialize score
score = 0
total_questions = len(questions)

# Check each answer
for question in questions:
    # ... display question and get user input ...
    if answer == question[6]:  # Correct answer
        print("✓ Correct!")
        score += 1
    else:
        print(f"✗ Wrong! The correct answer is {question[6]}.")

# Calculate and display results
print(f"Your score: {score}/{total_questions}")
percentage = (score / total_questions) * 100
print(f"Percentage: {percentage:.1f}%")
```

### Result Display Features:
- **Clear Formatting**: Uses visual separators and clear labels
- **Percentage Calculation**: Shows performance as a percentage
- **Personalized Feedback**: Provides encouraging messages based on performance
- **Performance Tiers**: 
  - 80%+: "Excellent! Great job!"
  - 60-79%: "Good work! Keep it up!"
  - 40-59%: "Not bad! Try again to improve!"
  - Below 40%: "Keep practicing! You'll do better next time!"
